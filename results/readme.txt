Data processing:

pp_results.py
For compiling the 1D-RT on-the-fly results into a single, easy to use table. pp stands for plane parallel. You must change the option within in order to make it work for either uniform or inhomogeneous density skewers.

vIF_conv_test.py
For the vIF convergence test where we compared I-front speeds calculated by doing spatial vs ionization state averages.

ud_csc_results.py
For cell size convergence test with uniform density skewers.

fd_csc_results.py
For cell size convergence test with fluctuating density skewers. 

Processed data tables are saved in the final_results/ directory.
