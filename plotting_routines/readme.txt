Paper plots, movies, and other helpful scripts:

Figure 1. A zoom-in on a typical I-front region traveling through an inhomogeneous density skewer.

lya_eff_temperature.py
Figure 2. Examples from our 1D-RT runs illustrating the dependence of I-front internal tempeature and Lyman-alpha production efficiency on I-front speed and spectral index.

pspace_lya_eff.py
Figure 3. Parameter space of the I-front Lyman-alpha production efficiency.

qual_movie.py
I made nice movies to visualize the progress of an I-front ionizing a skewer for my qualifying exam and my dissertaion defense.

constants.py
Helpful constants

functions.py
Helpful functions. get_inc_LyC_flux is especially helpful for calculating the incident Lyman-continuum flux. This is important because it is the denominator of the Lyman-alpha production efficiency.
